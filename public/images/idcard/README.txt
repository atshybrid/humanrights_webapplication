Place your exported background images from the PDF here as PNGs at print resolution.

Expected filenames:
- front-bg.png (front side background)
- back-bg.png  (back side background)

Sizing guidelines:
- Physical size: 54mm (W) Ã— 85.6mm (H) for portrait (CR80).
- Export at 300 DPI for print quality, or higher if available.
- Ensure the background images contain only the static artwork (no dynamic text/photo/signature) since those render on top dynamically.

Tip: After adding the images, open these URLs to preview at exact size with on-screen scaling:
- /members/id-card/123?scale=2
- /members/id-card/back/123?scale=2

If you change filenames, update MemberIdCardFront.js and MemberIdCardBack.js defaults accordingly.
